      "q2": "When does a matrix have no inverse?",
      "a2": "A matrix has no inverse if its determinant is zero. Such matrices are called singular matrices.",
      "q3": "What is the adjugate matrix?",
      "a3": "The adjugate matrix is the transpose of the cofactor matrix. It's used in the formula for finding the inverse of a matrix."

      "q1": "What is reduced row echelon form?",
      "a1": "Reduced row echelon form (RREF) is a special form of a matrix where: 1) All zero rows are at the bottom, 2) The leading entry in each non-zero row is 1, 3) Each leading 1 is the only non-zero entry in its column.",
      "q2": "How to convert a matrix to RREF?",
      "a2": "Use Gaussian-Jordan elimination: 1) Start with row echelon form, 2) Make all leading entries 1, 3) Eliminate all entries above and below each leading 1.",
      "q3": "What is the difference between REF and RREF?",
      "a3": "REF (row echelon form) requires zeros below leading entries, while RREF (reduced row echelon form) also requires zeros above leading entries and each leading entry to be 1."
