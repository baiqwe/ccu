      "q1": "How to find the inverse of a 3x3 matrix?",
      "a1": "To find the inverse of a 3x3 matrix, follow these steps: 1) Calculate the determinant - if it's zero, the matrix is singular and has no inverse. 2) Find the matrix of cofactors by calculating the determinant of each 2x2 minor matrix. 3) Transpose the cofactor matrix to get the adjugate matrix. 4) Multiply the adjugate matrix by 1/determinant to get the inverse.",
      "q2": "When does a matrix have no inverse?",
      "a2": "A matrix has no inverse if its determinant is zero. Such matrices are called singular or non-invertible matrices. This occurs when the rows or columns are linearly dependent, meaning one row is a linear combination of the others.",
      "q3": "What is the adjugate matrix?",
      "a3": "The adjugate matrix (also called the adjoint matrix) is the transpose of the cofactor matrix. It's a key component in the formula for finding the inverse: A⁻¹ = (1/det(A)) × adj(A). Each element in the adjugate is a signed minor determinant.",
      "q4": "What are the applications of inverse matrices?",
      "a4": "Inverse matrices are used extensively in: 1) Solving systems of linear equations (Ax = b becomes x = A⁻¹b), 2) Computer graphics for transformations and camera positioning, 3) Cryptography for encryption and decryption, 4) Control theory for system analysis, 5) Statistics for regression analysis."
    },
    "rref": {
      "q1": "What is reduced row echelon form?",
      "a1": "Reduced row echelon form (RREF) is a special form of a matrix with these properties: 1) All zero rows are at the bottom, 2) The leading entry (pivot) in each non-zero row is 1, 3) Each leading 1 is the only non-zero entry in its column, 4) Each leading 1 appears to the right of the leading 1 in the row above.",
      "q2": "How to convert a matrix to RREF?",
      "a2": "Use Gaussian-Jordan elimination: 1) Start with row echelon form using forward elimination, 2) Scale each pivot row so the leading entry becomes 1, 3) Eliminate all entries above each pivot by adding multiples of the pivot row to rows above it, 4) Continue until all conditions for RREF are satisfied.",
      "q3": "What is the difference between REF and RREF?",
      "a3": "Row Echelon Form (REF) requires only zeros below each pivot, while Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF) requires zeros both above and below each pivot. RREF also requires that all pivots equal 1. RREF is unique for any matrix, while REF is not.",
      "q4": "Why use RREF for solving systems?",
      "a4": "RREF makes solving systems of linear equations trivial because the solution can be read directly from the final matrix. Each pivot column corresponds to a basic variable, and the rightmost column (in an augmented matrix) gives the values. It also clearly reveals whether a system has no solution, one solution, or infinitely many solutions."
